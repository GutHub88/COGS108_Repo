This serves both as a way to get a 'feel' for the data, and to look for any quirks or oddities about the data, that may indicate issues that need resolving. To do this, let's explore that data a bit (not limiting ourselves to only features that we plan to use - exploring the dataset as a whole can help us find any issues). \n",

    "\n",
    "Sometimes we have data that have many dimensions, perhaps too many to deal with, and so we might need to try and use dimensionality reduction: that is to try and find a lower dimensional space that captures as much of the information as we can from the original, high-dimensional, dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, in our data, we have height and weight that are quite correlated, and we could use Principal Components Analysis (PCA), in order to try and capture the most information about a persons' height and weight in a single number - projecting this 2D data down into 1 dimension. \n",
